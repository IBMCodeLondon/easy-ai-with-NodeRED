## A brief introduction on some of the Watson Cognitive Services
As you can see, there are quite some nodes in the Watson node modules, and they are all used for different purposes. Each of the Watson nodes is corresponding to a specific Watson service on the IBM Cloud platform. You are able to view the documentation of each service in the info tab of these nodes.

+ **Assistant** : helps to interpret human language and host a simple conversation/dialog. This is the Watson component you'd use for building a Chatbot backend service. -- [Driving chatbot demo](https://conversation-simple.ng.bluemix.net/)

+ **Discovery** : helps prepare your unstructured data, create a query that will pinpoint the information you need, and then integrate those insights into your application or existing solution. This service also includes the continuously updated **News** service, giving access to current and recent news artciles from around the world -- [News demo](https://watson-news-intelligence-starter-kit.ng.bluemix.net/)

+ **Natural Language Classifier** : applies cognitive computing techniques to return the best matching classes for a sentence or phrase -- [Classifier demo](https://natural-language-classifier-demo.ng.bluemix.net/)

+ **Natural Language Understanding** : The Natural Language Understanding will analyze a block of text, an article or HTML data to output a JSON object that matches the input data with various index -- [NLU demo](https://natural-language-understanding-starter-kit.ng.bluemix.net/)

+ **Personality insights**: derives insights from user-created text/content (transactional and social media data) to identify psychological traits which might determine purchase decisions, intent and behavioral traits; may be utilized to improve retail conversion rates -- [Personality insights demo](https://personality-insights-livedemo.ng.bluemix.net/)

+ **Visual Recognition**: Analyze images for scenes, objects, faces, and other content. Choose a default model off the shelf, or create your own custom classifier. Develop smart applications that analyze the visual content of images or video frames to understand what is happening in a scene -- [Visual Recognizer demo](http://visual-recognition-starter-kit.ng.bluemix.net/)

+ **Speech to text**/**Text to speech**: for a growing set of spoken languages, converts from one form to another, allowing speech to be processed by text-oriented services like chatbots, Personality Insights, etc, and use speech synthesis to convert messages and text into audio streams -- [STT demo](https://speech-to-text-demo.ng.bluemix.net/), [TTS demo](https://text-to-speech-demo.ng.bluemix.net/)

+ **Tone Analyzer**: The Tone Analyzer service uses linguistic analysis to detect emotional tones, social propensities, and writing styles in written communication. This service will be used in this workshop to show how Node-RED nodes can be used to easily integrate Watson Cognitive Services into an application, with little or no AI skills -- [Tone Analyzer demo](https://tone-analyzer-demo.ng.bluemix.net/)
